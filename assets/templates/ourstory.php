						<h2 class="contentHeader">Our Story</h2>
						<p>Welcome to DK Catering where we strive to put great healthy home cooked food in your belly.
						Our specialty is home cooked family dinners. We love to cook and we want to share our passion with everyone.
						Ever since our kids have grown up and left the house, we wanted to continue and encourage healthy family eating so 
						our catering service was born. Our Service offers anyone and everyone a great healy home cooked meal personally or at any event.
						We noticed that this day in age, the concept of family dining is rapidly decreasing in homes. Most people would rather
						purchase fast food and eat in front of a Tv. We hope our food allows families to spend more time together in fellowship while they are eating. 
						We would also love to share their weekly recipes and daily ‘printable’ dinner discussion topics. We hope you enjoy what we have to offer! </p>
