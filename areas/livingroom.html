						<p>Our living room is a quite peculiar one, with high ceilings and windows that surround the entire room. It's the place where
						we all fought over what we would watch on the television.</p>

						<p>The room itself has changed so much over the years with the carpet being removed and a new one added
						(we used to eat out there and accidentally stained the carpet one too many times) and the couches being replaced like three times.
						However, what has remained the same is the sheer openness of the room, with it's high ceilings and square-like dimensions.<p>

						<p>The TV also went through different changes, with the wood panel that surrounds it being custom-made to have a huge gap in it
						so it could fit those old giant projector televisions. That thing stayed around for too many years before being replaced by
						something more modern, but now if someone bumps into it there's a chance the entire television could fall back. Talk about
						one expensive accident waiting to happen!</p>

						<p>When our house was originally built, I guess gas-powered fireplaces were all the rage, so my parents decided to buy one of
						those instead of a conventional fireplace. It worked for a few years but now it's a dying mess. It barely emits any heat and when
						you use it, it reaks of gas throughout the entire room, and since nobody likes the smell of gas, nobody uses it, making it virtually
						useless. I envy people with real fireplaces so much.</p>

						<p>However the complaints, it's a very comfy room and I tend to pass out on the couches after a long day. Nothing can beat those
						couches.</p>
