						<p>Ahh our basement. When the house was built the basement was finished as well, and was used as a place to study and do homework
						(which it still is used for). We would go down there and use some tables setup to finish homework, as it was a great spot to focus
						since it was nice and quiet.</p>

						<p>However, it wasn't always this simple. We asked our mom if we could turn it into an entertainment place and she hesitantly agreed.
						She bought us an air hockey table that we had a blast with, until someone cracked like four eggs over and they seeped into the air holes,
						so whenever someone turned it on, it would reak up the place of spoiled eggs. Unfortunately we had to throw away the table, and I still
						miss it to this day.</p>

						<p>During the winter months we would use the basement for playing frisbee catch, which was really a bad idea. It dented up the walls
						horribly and at one point my brother threw it too hard and it put a big hole in the wall. We panicked and went to the other side of the
						basement and grabbed some paint that sorta matched the colors of the wall. We desperately tried to fix the hole but it didn't work and
						my mother found out and was so angry. She grounded us all. She hired someone to fix it up.</p>

						<p>Me and my brothers also filmed silly videos down there at one point and did rediculous things down there, throwing storage bins at each
						other in pseudo battles amonst other things.</p>

						<p>A few years later we found my dad's old projector. The thing outputted a resolution of only 640x480 and it was so old that the serial
						code was only four digits long! We hung an old white bed sheet on the wall and watched movies and played video games from it. Then my
						mom bought us a sectional down there that she got from an auction at our neighbors house. The neighbor died in her sleep and nobody
						discovered her for a few months so it had this horrible smell to it at first and literally smelled like death. However after cleaning it
						a hundred times and leaving candles out next to it to absorb the smell it became fine and was the greatest couch I have ever sat on.</p>

						<p>Unfortunately she sold it to a few family friends and bought two separate couches that we use to this day. The projector also broke and my
						dad generously bought a giant TV that we now use down there. We go down there for homework and for entertainment now, but the memories that
						were made down there are invaluable.</p>
