						<p>The main entrance: the most significant place of any home. That's why we don't let anyone through it.</p>

						<figure class="main right">

						</figure>

						<p>The reason for this is because my mother likes having a nice place in her home to look at, but doesn't want
						anyone to ruin that image so she redirects everyone and I mean <b>EVERYONE</b> to the entrance on the other side of
						the house.</p>

						<p>On the outside the door is completely black with a gold handle, under two brick pillars. It would be more grand if
						people were allowed to use, but alas, it's not my home.</p>

						<p>Because it's really the most obvious entrance of the house, my mother has raged over the years because most everyone
						who came over would use it. Any packages would arrive right at it's doorstep. Trick or Treaters would knock furiously on
						it every year. It always brings a smile to my face though that people use it and that it drives my mother bonkers.</p>

						<p>When entering, you will first notice the chandelier and staircase that are directly in front of the door. However,
						the thing that strikes me as most interesting is this strange butler thing that I guess is supposed to be used for keys,
						but since nobody enters through this entrance he is sorta jobless. He's pretty nifty looking though!</p>

						<p>Connecting to the main entrance would be two dining rooms (that nobody is allowed to use, just like the main entrance),
						a staircase to upstairs, a staircase to the basement, and the entrance to the living room. So many choices but the only ones
						we ever make is either going downstairs to either the living room or basement, or vice versa.</p>

						<p>Maybe someday the entrance will be fully utilized, because it absolutely deserves it!</p>
