						<h2 class="contentHeader">Backyard</h2>
						<p>Whenever the weather permits, me and my siblings used to come out here all the time and have a blast.
						Unfortunately, our backyard is on a revine (hence why we technically have three floors instead of two
						floors and a basement) so running outside to catch the summer rays can result in you falling down the
						hill and into the trees at the bottom.</p>

						<p>We have a swing set in our backyard that, as kids, we would mess around on all day! Climbing it,
						making obstacle courses that we would race through, and dragging the hose to the slide and flooding it
						to make a waterslide was a blast! Even if my mother screamed that we were wasting water, we still had
						so much fun.</p>

						<p>If you go past the backyard, there is a vast area of woods that we would explore. We even setup a
						camp site and built firepits. When exploring it we would travel for hours through the trails and it
						was such a great adventure.</p>

						</figure>

						<p>Back at the house, there are two decks. A top one that connects to the second floor, and a bottom
						one that connects to the first floor. We go outside to the top deck during the summers and cook on
						our grill and eat outside, which was really nice and we have always loved doing it</p>

						<p>Overall, when the weather is great, we go outside and have a ball!</p>
