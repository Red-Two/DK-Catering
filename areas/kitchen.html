						<p>Our Kitchen is where we come to eat! However, throughout the day there are constantly people in this room
						(eight people live in the house, six siblings and two parents total) so it's hard to eat alone, if that's your thing.</p>

						<p>The Kitchen was a little different when we first moved in. In order to make sure we wouldn't run off when people were
						watching us, we had gates between the two entrances of the kitchen. However as we grew older, we just unlocked them or
						climbed over them so my parents had them removed. There is still one however that separates the Kitchen from the dining room.</p>

						<p>Another safety implementation that my parents implemented is a magnetic lock for each cupboard, where you have to slide a magnet
						over the side of it to unlock it. Yet again, we grew out of them and they are extremely cumbersome at this point, where we rip open
						the cupboards sometimes because we are too lazy to find the magnet for unlocking them.</p>

						<p>There is also a million lights in the room, so the only thing people have to worry about is going blind.</p>

						<p>The kitchen has two eating areas: an island and a massive table. The island is what you would expect, high seats that you sit on
						and you can eat there, however the main table for eating at is interesting. The top is fully black marble and it's a treat to eat on.</p>

						<p>However, we don't usually eat on it all that often as everyone has different schedules because of school, but when we do it's
						absolutely wonderful to have everyone at a single table able to share what happened that day, and I enjoy every chance I have to
						experience it.</p>
