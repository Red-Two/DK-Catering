						<h2 class="contentHeader">Grading</h2>
						<p>Here I will be discussing the grading criteria and how I implemented each.</p>
						<p><b>CRAP</b></p>
						<p>Contrast - Lights are for content while darker shades are for browing the different pages.
						Hovering over the navigational element provides contrast as well that really speaks to the user.</p>
						<p>Repetition - Each page has the navigation, a billboard with an image that describes the page,
						and a content header that describes the content about to be read by the user.</p>
						<p>Alignment - Everything is coded to be aligned perfectly, whether you are viewing from a desktop
						or mobile device, it all flows together perfectly.</p>
						<p>Proximity - I felt that proximity was most important for the content so that's where I focused it
						on the most, with padding between content and example images large enough to separate them both and
						while viewing on a mobile device the example images take up full width as to make the separation much
						more clear when viewing on a smaller screen.</p>
						<p><b>Organization of Information</b></p>
						<p>The organization of information is clear and concise, with paragraphs flowing nicely and the graphics
						that accompany them relating to the content at hand.</p>
						<p><b>Content</b></p>
						<p>The content is mainly generated based on memories of the places described to make it most interesting to
						the user and maybe even make them think of their homes in the process and the memories that come with them.
						The reason a map was not included was for security reasons, as I wouldn't want people to know the exact layout
						of my parents house for obvious reasons. While the floor structure may be a bit personal to put, I made sure
						to leave out direct connections of rooms.</p>
						<p><b>Navigation</b></p>
						<p>Main categories are listed on the navigation bar at the top while secondary elements and the 'Scroll to Top'
						button are listed in the footer. This is done as to bring the most important elements directory to the user
						immediately while secondary elements are at the bottom as to not be intrusive to the user's viewing experience.</p>
						<p><b>HTML5 and CSS3</b></p>
						<p>HTML5 semantic code is used, such as the header, footer, nav and figure tags as to promote a modern website.
						CSS3 is also used with child selecting and transitions to make the website feel modern and make selectable elements
						more interactive to the end user. I coded a mobile-friendly navigation menu in JavaScript that makes browing the
						navigational elements much easier when using a mobile device, and example images fit to the screen when using such
						device as to make viewing on these devices much more enjoyable.</p>
						<p><b>SSI</b></p>
						<p>I am using Apache's SSI system to include repeated content such as the header and footer elements. With this, I
						am also using a very basic routing system. All that is needed to use it is to define 'ROUTE' in the '.htaccess' folder.
						This allows for easy transfer between servers.</p>
